Part One: Solidify Terminology
In your own terms, define the following terms:

What is HTTP?
- The protocol that is used to retrieve webpages

What is a URL?
- An alias to connect to a server

What is DNS?
- A server that helps translate hostnames to ip addresses

What is a query string?
- A query string is a string used to pass parameters in a url like when you submit forms

What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
- GET will request resources from a server. POST will submit resources to a server.

What is an HTTP request?
- A HTTP request is a request your browser makes to ask a server for a webpage

What is an HTTP response?
- An HTTP response is a response from a server with the resulting webpage

What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
- Headers will give additional information about the requests or responses
Request headers: Host, User-Agent, Accept, Cookie, Cache-Control
Response headers: Content-Type, Last-Modified, Set-Cookie, Cache-Control

What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
- Your browser makes a request to the server for a webpage. The server may need to gather resources from other servers like
a database and then gives the browser back the page. The browser displays the response, and some other requests may need to be 
made for things like stylesheets or scripts.
