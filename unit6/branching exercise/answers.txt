Part I
Answer the following questions:

What git command creates a branch?
git checkout -b branch_name

What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?
The fast-forward merge only happens when the main branch doesn't have any previous commits.

What git command changes to another branch?
git checkout branch_name

What git command deletes a branch?
git branch -d branch_name

How do merge conflicts happen?
Merge conflicts happen when you try to merge a branch into another, and there are conflicts on the same line. You 
need to resolve the issue by making changes and committing them on the branch, and then merging again.


Part II
Practice with fast forward and recursive merges! Make a branch and add and commit onto it and merge it back into master.

Try to create your own merge conflict by modifying the same file on two separate commits on two separate branches.
Conflicts here!
